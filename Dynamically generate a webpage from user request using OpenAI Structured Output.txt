This workflow is a experiment to build HTML pages from a user input using the new Structured Output from OpenAI.

How it works:

Users add what they want to build as a query parameter
The OpenAI node generate an interface following a structured output defined in the body
The JSON output is then converted to HTML along with a title
The HTML is encapsulated in an HTML node (where the Tailwind css script is added)
The HTML is rendered to the user via the Webhook response.
Set up steps

Create an OpenAI API Key
Create the OpenAI credentials
Use the credentials for both nodes HTTP Request (as Predefined Credential type) and OpenAI
Activate your workflow
Once active, go to the production URL and add what you'd like to build as the parameter "query"
Example: https://production_url.com?query=a%20signup%20form
