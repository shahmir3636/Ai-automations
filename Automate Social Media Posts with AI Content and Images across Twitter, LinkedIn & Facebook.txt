Auto-generate & post content using AI
This workflow helps you create daily content using just a topic prompt. It writes a tweet, generates an image, and publishes across Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn — all on autopilot.

How it works
Triggers daily at 10 PM to start the flow
Uses OpenAI to generate a niche topic title
Writes a short-form post (tweet style) with hashtags
Generates a Japanese anime-style image for visual context
Saves everything in Google Sheets
Publishes automatically on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook
Set up steps
You’ll need OpenAI, Google Sheets, and social media credentials (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn)
Takes about 10–15 minutes to configure if you already have the credentials ready
Make sure your Sheet and API keys are properly linked before activating
