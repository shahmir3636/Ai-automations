This cost ~$0.01 per run. You must put money, recommend no more than $5, into your open ai account.\n-Click on your profile again. On left hand side click on billing.

Copy and Past the URL. The workflow will automatically initiate. When it has completed open the Evaluator Tools Agent and click on Logs. Scroll down until you see output. This is your information. It is rated on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being most likely the URL is a scam. I recommend copy and pasting it to a word document for ease of access at a later date. You can always find prior searches by clicking on executions at the top. You then right click and open the Evaluator tools agent. Clicking on logs at the top and you will see the output information again. \n\nDisclaimer:\nThis tool is designed to assist in evaluating the potential risk of websites using AI-generated insights.
